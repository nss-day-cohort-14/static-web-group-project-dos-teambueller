				<h1>ABOUT THOM'S CRUISES</h1>
			
				<p align="justify">THOM'S CRUISES is the 32nd largest cruise line in the world.  Following in the bane of Davey Jones, we scour the planet looking for adventure, and are more than willing to take along passengers to pay for it all!  </p>

					<h2 class="">HISTORY</h2>

						<p align="justify">Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about? Then, all things considered...it's time I grew up. I don't have a future. Oh, the pointing again! They're screwdrivers! What are you going to do? Assemble a cabinet at them? And in that battle there was a man with more blood on his hands than any other. A man who would commit a crime that would silence the universe. And that man was me. Do you have to talk like children? What is it that makes you so ashamed of being a grown-up? Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about?</p>

				<h2 class="">MISSION</h2>

						<p align="justify">I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could... New-new-Doctor. I don't want to go. What? What?! WHAT?! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff.</p>
