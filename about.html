				<h2 class="">MISSION</h2>

						<p align="justify">Thom's Cruises is looking to expand and improve its business. Therefore, the firm has
							three main goals it hopes to achieve; expand services by adding new ports, become the global
						leader in family entertainment within the cruise industry, and increase brand awareness. The firm
						will add one new port every two years over the course of the next 20 years to reach its expansion
						goal.</p>

						<p align="justify">Thom's Cruises will become the leader in family entertainment by providing superior
						customer service, state of the art facilities, and unforgettable experiences. The organization will
						increase brand awareness by running 30 second, primetime television commercials including
						discounts and promotional packages. This will increase the firmâ€™s customer base, therefore; the
						brand name will spread through word of mouth. The specifics of how these goals will be
						achieved are discussed in later sections. </p>
